To start using GPIO sensors like 1W 18B20 temperature sensors, you will need to install the OpenPlotter GPIO app.  OpenPlotter apps are installed from the OpenPlotter -> Settings application.  Click *Refresh* to verify the installed Apps.  By default GPIO is not installed so select it and click *Install*.  After installation, you will now see the GPIO app in the OpenPlotter menu.

When you open the GPIO app, you will now see your 1-Wire sensors listed.  You will need to edit them to add the correct Signal-K key name.  The names have a specific format and the *Edit* button will assist you with creating the correct key name.

It is important to use a valid key name so that Signal K will utilize the correct unit of measure.

After you have added a Signal K key, you should see your sensor listed in the Signal K *Data Browser*.
