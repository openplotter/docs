Connecting
##########

You can connect your MAIANA AIS device to an OpenPlotter running on a Raspberry Pi, either by a USB adapter or a UART adapter and only by a USB adapter if OpenPlotter is running on a desktop/laptop.

The UART adapter is included with the *MAIANA™ AIS base kit*. Any of the other 3 adapters available has a USB connection: *USB*, *USB + RS422* and *USB + CAN*.
