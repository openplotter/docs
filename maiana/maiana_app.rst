MAIANA AIS Transponder
######################

.. image:: img/maiana1.png

The main difference between MAIANA and all commercial AIS devices is that it is a self-contained unit, all AIS and GNSS circuits are located in the antenna housing. MAIANA receives GNSS and AIS data on both channels and can be enabled as a class B transponder. The transponder outputs just over 2 Watts (+33dBm).

.. note::
	This product is available in the `OpenMarine Shop <http://shop.openmarine.net/>`_ for European users.

	On the `official page <https://github.com/peterantypas/maiana>`_ you will find the full specification and a better choice for US/Canada users.
