How to collaborate
##################

	Everything takes **time**, **money** and **monkeys**. You need a lot from any two groups and a little from the third. An increase in any one reduces the requirement for the other two. Change occurs when one of those three change.

	-- Moe's Law (Navigatrix project)​

**Time**

Download and install OpenPlotter and test and test and test ...

Report bugs and request new features in `OpenMarine forums <http://forum.openmarine.net/>`_.

Spread the word among your friends in ports and forums.

**Money**

This project is financed by `selling related products <https://shop.sailoog.com/>`_ or by `voluntary contributions <https://paypal.me/sailoog>`_.

**Monkeys**

	Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.

	-- Ernest Shackleton

Translations
*************

If you want to help translate the software into your language, create an account on the Crowdin platform and edit `the project <https://crowdin.com/project/openplotter>`_.


Documentation
*************

If you want to help us maintain this documentation, let us know what your intentions are in `the forum <http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16>`_ to coordinate.

The best way to do this is to fork `this repository GitHub <https://github.com/openplotter/docs>`_ and push your commits.

If you are not familiar with GitHub, do not worry, send us your contributions to `the forum <http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16>`_.

**Guidelines**

- We will no longer maintain translations, just the source in English. We tried but we failed. This project is too much dynamic and even maintaining this documentation is a hard job. Translators coordination is not an option either. We are going to do what OpenCPN does, schematic and concise documentation just for reference. We do not want manuals, tutorials or detailed "How-to's". That makes people free to generate their detailed manuals, tutorials or videos for newbies in their language. That works for OpenCPN so let's try.

- Remember, this is a reference book, not a tutorial. Be brief and concise.

- A picture is worth a thousand words. In order to keep the same style use this tool to make screenshots:

	.. parsed-literal::

		sudo apt install gnome-screenshot

	with these settings:

	.. image:: img/screenshot.png

- English is not our main language and there will be many grammatical mistakes, help us solve it too.
